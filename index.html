  <h1>20 HTML TAGS</h1>
  <h3>blockquote</h3>
    <p>
      The <em>blockquote</em> (or HTML Block Quotation Element) indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation. Usually, this is rendered visually by indentation (see Notes for how to change it). A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the cite attribute, while a text representation of the source can be given using the <em>cite</em> element.
      <br><b>Example:</b>
      <blockquote>This is a blockquote</blockquote>
    </p>
  <!--<dd>	The <dd> provides the details about or the definition of the preceding term (<dt>) in a description list (<dl>).
  <dir>	The obsolete HTML Directory element (<dir>) is used as a container for a directory of files and/or folders, potentially with styles and icons applied by the user agent.
  <div>	The HTML Content Division element (<div>) is the generic container for flow content. It has no effect on the content or layout until styled using CSS.
  <dl>	The <dl>element represents a description list.The element encloses a list of groups of terms (specified using the <dt> element) and descriptions (provided by <dd> elements). Common uses for this element are to implement a glossary or to display metadata (a list of key-value pairs).
  <dt>	The <dt> specifies a term in a description or definition list, and as such must be used inside a <dl> element.
  <figcaption>	The <figcaption> represents a caption or legend for the rest of the contents its parent <figure> element, if any.
  <figure>	The <figure> represents self-contained content, frequently with a caption (<figcaption>), and is typically referenced as a single unit.
 -->
  <h3>hr</h3>
    <p>
      The <em>hr</em> represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic with a section.
      <br><b>Example:</b>
      This is a horizontal line</p>
      <hr>
    </p>
  <h3>li</h3>	
    <p>The <em>li</em> is used to represent an item in a list. It must be contained in a parent element: an ordered list (<em>ol</em>), an unordered list (<em>ul</em>).
       <br><b>Example:</b>
       <li>This is a li</li>
    </p>
  <h3>main</h3> 
    <p>The <em>main</em> represents the dominant content of the body of a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.
    
  <!--<ol>	The <ol> represents an ordered list of items, typically rendered as a numbered list.
  <p>	The <p> represents a paragraph.
  <pre>	The <pre> represents preformatted text which is to be presented exactly as written in the HTML file.
  <ul>	The<ul> represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted list.
  -->
  <h3>a</h3>	
    <p>The <em>a</em> (or anchor element) creates a hyperlink to other web pages, files, locations within the same page, email addresses, or any other URL.

    </p>
  <h3>abbr</h3>	
    <p>
      The HTML Abbreviation element (<em>abbr</em>) represents an abbreviation or acronym; the optional title attribute can provide an expansion or description for the abbreviation.
    <br><b>Example:</b>
    <abbr>U.N.O</abbr>
    </p>
  <h3>b</h3>	
    <p>The HTML Bring Attention To element, used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance.
    <br><b>Example:</b>
    <b>This is a bold text</b>
    
  <h3>bdi</h3>	
    <p>The HTML Bidirectional Isolate element tells the browser's bidirectional algorithm to treat the text it contains in isolation from its surrounding text.
    </p>
  <h3>bdo</h3>	
    <p>The HTML Bidirectional Text Override element overrides the current directionality of text, so that the text within is rendered in a different direction.</p>
  <h3>cite</h3>	
    <p>The HTML Citation element is used to describe a reference to a cited creative work, and must include either the title or author or the URL of that work.
    </p>
  <h3>code</h3>	
    <p>This displays its contents styled in a fashion intended to indicate that the text is a short fragment of computer code.
    </p>
  <h3>i</h3>	
    <p>This represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason. Some examples include technical terms, foreign language phrases, or fictional character thoughts. It is typically displayed in italic type.
    </p>

    </p>
  <h3>q</h3>	
    <p>This indicates that the enclosed text is a short inline quotation. Most modern browsers implement this by surrounding the text in quotation marks.
    <br><b>Example:</b>
    <q>This is a quotation</q>
    </p>
  <!--<rb>	The <rb> is used to delimit the base text component of a <ruby> annotation, i.e. the text that is being annotated.
  <rp>	The <rp> is used to provide fall-back parentheses for browsers that do not support display of ruby annotations using the <ruby> element.
  <rt>	The <rt> specifies the ruby text component of a ruby annotation, which is used to provide pronunciation, translation, or transliteration information for East Asian typography. The <rt> element must always be contained within a <ruby> element.
  <rtc>	The <rtc> embraces semantic annotations of characters presented in a ruby of <rb> elements used inside of <ruby> element. <rb> elements can have both pronunciation (<rt>) and semantic (<rtc>) annotations.
  <ruby>	The <ruby> represents a ruby annotation. Ruby annotations are for showing pronunciation of East Asian characters.
 -->
  <h3>s</h3>	
    <p>This renders text with a strikethrough, or a line through it. Use this element to represent things that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate. However, it is not appropriate when indicating document edits.

  <h3>small</h3>	
    <p>This element makes the text font size one size smaller (for example, from large to medium, or from small to x-small) down to the browser's minimum font size. In HTML5, this element is repurposed to represent side-comments and small print, including copyright and legal text, independent of its styled presentation.
    <br><b>Example:</b>
    <small>This is a small tag</small>
    </p>
  <h3>strong</h3>	
    <p>The HTML Strong Importance Element (<em>strong</em> ) indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type.
    <br><b>Example:</b>
    <strong>This is a strong tag</strong>
  <h3>var</h3>	
    <p>The HTML Variable element (<em>var</em>) represents the name of a variable in a mathematical expression or a programming context.
    <br><b>Example:</b>
    <var>This is a var tag</var>
</body>
